  <h2>Preface</h2> <br>
  <p>Recently I have decided to catalog what I am throwing out each week. Despite 99% of the trash I throw out being very mundane and not worth noting there's a handful of things that happen to have a nice story paired with them. I think it could be quite fun to record and collect those stories here. Granted not every item is that interesting, some weeks just had less going on than others I guess. However I’ve done my best to collect some noteworthy items, as well as including a photo of each item that I am throwing away. </p> <br>

    <h2>Overview</h2><br>
    <p>This week was a pretty random assorment of items. If I had to find a commanality the closest I could come up with is that most of these are finally being thrown out thanks to a much needed start of the semester cleaning. A lot of these things were items that pilled up towards the end of fall and because of finals I never got around to throwing them away unfortunately.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Health</h3><br>
    <p>Items that were related to medication, I threw out a few empty medication containers and even picked up a new medication at one point this week and was then able to throw out the packaging from that</p><br>
    
    <h3>Nails</h3><br>
    <p>This weeks featured item is a part of this category. These are items that relate to my time doing nail art and nail tech related shenanigans. On top of the isopropyl alcohol I also went through the assortment of press ons that I had laying around and got rid of the ones I didnt like as well as discovering one that had been dissolved by a mystery liquid that is for polygel. </p><br>

  <h3>Art</h3><br>
    <p>As other parts of my site have noted I like art and am always down for a random craft. This week I finished up some yarn for one of my crochet projects so I am now able to throw out the paper sleeve that I bought the yarn in. I also finally got a new tip to my apple pen and am able to replace this old one that ive had for years and is in dire need of replacement.</p><br>

  <h3>Random</h3><br>
    <p>These are some items that I don't really know how to categorize with the other items above. This week I threw out a few soda and seltzer cans that had begun to form a little wall on my desk over the past month. I also got rid of the pair of headphones that I snapped a few weeks back and despite my best efforts to repair them have been unable to. Lastly, I'm throwing out the packaging to a blindbox that my friend gave me for Christmas. I wanted to keep it since the boxes tend to be cute but honestly this box is quite big and I don't have anywhere to put it so I'm getting rid of it.</p>

          <h2>Description</h2>
    
   <p>My first item that I am throwing away is an empty bottle of isopropyl alcohol. The bottle itself is far from noteworthy, I got it from Target a couple months back and it looks almost identical to the day I got it. The only change, aside from it being empty, are the small smudges of gel polish that now adorn this plastic bottle.</p>    
   <p>I bought this about five or six months ago and just finished the bottle last week but had forgotten to throw it away. My reason for purchasing this and using all this isopropyl alcohol in a relatively short span of time is that I had begun doing my nails with gel polish. Despite doing my nails for several years now I had yet to touch gel polish. However after enrolling in nail tech school that changed real quick. </p>
  <p>Isopropyl alcohol can be used to remove uncured gel polish or to remove the sticky layer off cured gel polish before filing it. I technically haven't finished all of the alcohol from this bottle as the remaining amount is in a spray bottle since it's easier to use the alcohol when it's in a spray bottle over this bottle. </p>
