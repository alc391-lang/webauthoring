    <h1>Item of the Week - Isopropyl Acholol</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>My first item that I am throwing away is an empty bottle of isopropyl alcohol. The bottle itself is far from noteworthy, I got it from Target a couple months back and it looks almost identical to the day I got it. The only change, aside from it being empty, are the small smudges of gel polish that now adorn this plastic bottle.</p>    
    <p>I bought this about five or six months ago and just finished the bottle last week but had forgotten to throw it away. My reason for purchasing this and using all this isopropyl alcohol in a relatively short span of time is that I had begun doing my nails with gel polish. Despite doing my nails for several years now I had yet to touch gel polish. However after enrolling in nail tech school that changed real quick. </p>
    <p>Isopropyl alcohol can be used to remove uncured gel polish or to remove the sticky layer off cured gel polish before filing it. I technically haven't finished all of the alcohol from this bottle as the remaining amount is in a spray bottle since it's easier to use the alcohol when it's in a spray bottle over this bottle. </p> <br>
